What is a bookmarklet?
Bookmarklets are clever little tools that work like bookmarks but include small pieces of code to enhance how a website functions. You’ll find them in your browser’s bookmarks menu, just like regular bookmarks.

One drawback: bookmarklets can’t easily be assigned a custom icon, which is why they may appear a bit plain.
